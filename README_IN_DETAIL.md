Why this repository?
--------------
To put it simply, we want the Philosophy of GitHub to be understood by more people, especially those programmers-to-be and non-programmers (project managers for instance). To achieve this aim, we have come up with the idea of this repository — a repository letting people learn GitHub without coding. So, this repository takes a very simple example — uploading images meeting certain rules, which is very familiar to most of the people since they may have done this in other platforms. By managing branches, making pull requests and let them pass Continuous Integration and human approval, they will make acquaintance of GitHub .

Will this repository take up a lot of GitHub’s resources?
---------------
No.
GitHub has a recommended [size limitation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota) of 1GB for a repository. We also require the contributors to compress images. A pull request of an image more than 1MB will be closed. In the future, we may delete some old files (as well as their records) to keep the size of this repository.

Is this repository really helpful?
---------------
We think the answer is yes. This project could interest and have already interested many people to learn GitHub. It teaches people what is the workflow of GitHub, why we should do things like this and how to use GitHub. This project also helps people to be aware of the importance of solving problems, such as how to control the size of the repository and how to ensure the quality of the images, by discussing. Many problems are solved using the solutions provided by the community.
